Hi there! I'm Quique, and I'm currently working as an SDE at Amazon. On my free time, I like reading, hiking, plants, cats and Open Source Software. Here's my web: [**enriquekesslerm.com**](https://enriquekesslerm.com), where you'll find posts about any of those.

Below you'll find a featured repo, which is one of my 10th last updated. Below the repo card, you'll find an ordered list of my repositories and their languages, which shows the languages that I work with the most, and the ones I have been working with as of late, for my personal projects.
